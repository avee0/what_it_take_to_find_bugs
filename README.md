# what_it_take_to_find_bugs

This it notes of https://infosecwriteups.com/what-it-takes-to-find-bugs-in-bounties-273ad278f77e

key point:
1. type of bug hunter
   1. who love to hack in program
   2. second who comes for only money


for second type of people:
Moving on the second type:) Lets assume you want to find P1s and P2s but not getting them, try to explore your target as much as you can.
Subdomains are likely to be more insecure. If you get a subdomain with some good functionalities for eg. file uploads and external URLs upload, there are more chances you will find a good bug out there. Also, chaining is really important. Suppose you found a reflected XSS, try to craft a payload which contains some SQLi or SSRF paylaods. I have seen it working many times. Also, if you get a bug like XSS, try to find it in every subdomain where you get almost same funtionalities.


Gold mine:
In the end, it is all about how differently you can think. See web apps are built to hack. Not a single application is 100% safe. If we can hack Apple, we can hack anything. So never feel disappointed and never underestimate yourself. If you don’t have much skillset than others, build it. Learning is a process which never ends. Remember, hacking is not a destination, it’s a journey. Once you are in, there is no way out if you love hacking. We might have different brains but we all have same opportunities. Utilize your time in good things, rest all are temporary, hacking is forever:)
